# Lending-Club-Interest-Rate-Prediction
“LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company. The company claims that $15.98 billion in loans had been originated through its platform up to December 31, 2015. Lending Club enables borrowers to create unsecured personal loans between $1,000 and $40,000. The standard loan period is three years. Investors can search and browse the loan listings on Lending Club website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. Investors make money from interest. Lending Club makes money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee.”
With the release of Lending club data , a lot of researchers and practitioners are leveraging this dataset to understand credit risk, borrowing patterns, investment opportunities and to understand consumer choice and behaviors. This dataset is a gold mine to teach data science [3] and a lot of schools are using it to teach data science.
## Task 1:
Framing: Understanding your client, available data and exploratory data analysis
## Task 2: Data preparation
Data cleansing, Pre-processing, Feature engineering
1. Put together a plan for data cleaning, pre-processing and do feature engineering
2. Use Featuretools (https://github.com/featuretools/featuretools/ ) to do the same.
3. Write a note on your observations on featureTools vs manual Feature engineering
## Task 3: Prediction
1. Your goal is to build 3 models (Regression, Random forest, Neural Networks) to predict interest rates. Write a design spec for your methodology for designing each model. Discuss your Independent and Dependent variables.
2. Try all the 3 models and use MAPE as a criteria to choose the best model. Summarize MAPE for both Training and Testing data.
3. Try 5-fold cross validation. How does the model performance change.
